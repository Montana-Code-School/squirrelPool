Nuts and Boats, a React Native based squirrel pirate game.
Created on April 4th, 2018.
We are using React Navigation for app navigation. For more info/official docs, visit: `https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation`.

Island mapping:
  upper left: island1,
  lower right: island2,
  

Instructions to start:
 - after forking from github into your own repository
 - in the terminal, type `npm init` or `yarn init` and press enter.
 - then type either `npm install` or `yarn install` and press enter.
 - after creating your package.json, make sure you have the dev dependencies
    `enzyme`, `enzyme-adapter-react-16`, `jest-expo`, `react-native-scripts`,
    and `react-test-rendrer`.
 - and that you have the npm packages `expo`, `react-game-kit`, `react`, `react-dom`,
    `react-native`, and `react-navigation`.
 - We decided to move away from using MobX with React-Game-Kit since we are using a   mounted Create-React-Native-App build.
